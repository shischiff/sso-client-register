# sso-client-register

This is a web client for registering clients with RH-SSO (Red Hat Single Sign On).

The software provides a web GUI as well as a HTTP RESTful api.
It supports sending create client requests to one or more RHSSO endpoints

## Prerequisites

nodejs and npm

versions: [TBD]

Make sure to enable access from the host to your RHSSO server(s) by adding its hostname, IP or the entire domain to the trusted hosts in the Realm settings under "Client Registrations Policies"

## Installation

        yum install npm
        cd <working directory>
        npm install -g forever
        npm install

## Configuration

Edit the config file under config/env.config.js
The single important parameter is **sso_endpoints** 
This parameter is in the form of an array of objects and should include the name and the full endpoint url for your RHSSO(s)

e.g:

     ...
        "sso_endpoints": [
            {
                "name": "rhsso-1",
                "url": "http://sso1.example.com:8080/auth/realms/master/clients-registrations/openid-connect"
            },
            {
                "name": "rhsso-2",
                "url": "http://sso2.example.com:8080/auth/realms/master/clients-registrations/openid-connect"
            }
        ]
     ...
## Running the server

    npm start 

Alternatively for better robustness use forever to automatically restarting the server after a crush:

    forever start app.js
    
And to make it survive a rebbot
        
     crontab -e
Next, let's add an entry to the bottom of this file:

     @reboot forever start <path/to/app>/app.js

 
## Usage

There are two options to use the server:

### 1. Web UI
Go to http://<server's address>:3200

Fill theform and hit the 'Apply' button, the request will be send to RHSSO (one or more servers, according to the configuration file)
Once completed the result of the request(s) will be displayed at the top the screen.     

### 2. REST API
    
It is possible to send POST requests to /new_client providing application/json body with the following parameters:
    
* secret - 5 charcters minimum
* redirectUris - an array containing the redirect url (e.g: ["https://www.example-application.com/oauth2/redirectUri"])
* name - application name

E.g:
    
    curl -X POST \
      http://localhost:3200/new_client \
      -H 'content-type: application/json' \
      -d '{
          "secret": "secret123!",
          "redirectUris": ["https://www.example-application.com/oauth2/redirectUri-1", "https://www.example-application.com/oauth2/redirectUri-2"],
          "name": "myClientName"
            }'
